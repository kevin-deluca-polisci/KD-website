I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Yale University. I study American politics, and my research interests include historical political economy, elections and election law, and media.

I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at MIT and Faculty Affiliate of the MIT Election Data and Science Lab, during the 2025-2026 academic year.

I am also a Resident Fellow at the Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS) and Faculty Affiliate at the Center for American Political Studies (CSAP), both at Yale. Previously, I was an affiliate of the Center for American Political Studies (CAPS) and Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences (IQSS) at Harvard. I have also worked for the MIT Election Data and Science Lab (MEDSL) and was part of the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project.
